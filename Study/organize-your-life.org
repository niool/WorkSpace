        Finding tasks to be refiled
        Finding stuck projects
        Finding NEXT tasks to work on
        Show all related tasks
        Reviewing projects
        Finding tasks waiting on something
        Findings tasks to be archived
    Finding notes
    Viewing habits

* My working day
 My day goes generally like this:
 - Punch in (this starts the clock on the default task)
 - Look at the agenda and make a mental note of anything important to deal with today
 - Read email and news
   - create notes, and tasks for things that need responses with org-capture
 - Check refile tasks and respond to emails
 - Look at my agenda and work on important tasks for today
   - Clock it in
   - Work on it until it is DONE or it gets interrupted
 - Work on tasks
 - Make journal entries (C-c c j) for interruptions
 - Punch out for lunch and punch back in after lunch
 - work on more tasks
 - Refile tasks to empty the list
   - Tag tasks to be refiled with m collecting all tasks for the same target
   - Bulk refile the tasks to the target location with B r
   - Repeat (or refile individually with C-c C-w) until all refile tasks are gone
 - Mark habits done today as DONE
 - Punch out at the end of the work day


* How to organize under Emacs Org-Mode
** Tasks are separated into logical groupings or projects.
** Use separate org files for large groupings and subdirectories for collections of files for multiple projects that belong together.
